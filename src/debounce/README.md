# Debounce

The debounce function can be a game-changer when it comes to event-fueled performance.  If you aren't using a debouncing function with a ```scroll```, ```resize```, ```key*``` event, you're probably doing it wrong. 

The debounce function will not allow a callback to be used more than once per given time frame.  This is especially important when assigning a callback function to frequently-firing events.
